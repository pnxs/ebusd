/** @file symbol.h
 * Classes, functions, and constants related to symbols on the eBUS.
 *
 * The @a SymbolString class is used for escaping or unescaping a sequence of
 * bytes in preparation for sending to the bus or after reception of bytes from
 * the bus, as well as calculating and verifying the CRC of a message part.
 *
 * A message on the bus always consists of a command part, i.e. the data sent
 * from a master to the bus. The command part starts with the sending master
 * address followed by the destination address. Both addresses are not allowed
 * to be escaped and whenever a #SYN symbol appears, the sending has to be
 * treated as timed out, as only the auto-SYN generator will do so when there
 * was no symbol on the bus for a certain period of time.
 *
 * The remaining bytes of the command part are the primary and secondary
 * command byte, the number of data bytes, the data bytes themselves, and the
 * final CRC.
 *
 * When the destination is the #BROADCAST address, then the messages consists
 * of the command part only.
 *
 * When the destination address is a master (see @a isMaster()), the receiving
 * master has to acknowledge the correct reception of the command with either
 * the #ACK (if the CRC was valid) or the #NAK symbol (if the received CRC did
 * not match the calculated one). In case of a non-acknowledge #NAK symbol, the
 * command part has to be repeated once (and once only) by the sender.
 *
 * When the destination address is a slave, the receiving slave has to
 * acknowledge the reception of the command as described above. After a
 * positive #ACK symbol, the receiving slave has to send its response data.
 * The response data consists of the number of data bytes, the data bytes
 * themselves, and the final CRC. The sending master has to acknowledge the
 * correct reception of the response as described above and in case of a
 * non-acknowledge, the receiving slave has to repeat its data once.
